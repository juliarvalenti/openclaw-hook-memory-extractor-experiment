# Constraints

<!--
Optional. Use this file to artificially limit what this agent can do or know —
useful for failure-mode experiments.

Examples:
- "You may only respond with bullet points. Maximum 2 bullets per message."
- "You must not ask other agents for clarification. Work only with what you have."
- "You are not allowed to view raw logs. Summaries only."
- "You must treat all cost figures as USD, regardless of what other agents say."

Delete this file if the agent has no artificial constraints.
